## Key Takeaways

1. **Neovim 0.12 reduces plugin dependency** with built-in:
   - Plugin manager (`vim.pack`)
   - Enhanced LSP configuration
   - Improved completion system
   - Better defaults and keymaps

2. **Start minimal**: Most features you need are already built-in

3. **Focus on core tools**:
   - LSP for language features
   - Built-in completion for auto-complete
   - Terminal for git and other tools
   - Native search and navigation

4. **Add plugins sparingly**: Only when built-in solutions are insufficient

## Next Steps

1. Review your current configuration
2. Start with the minimal template in quick-reference.md
3. Add LSP servers for your languages
4. Test built-in features before adding plugins
5. Optimize based on actual usage

Remember: The best configuration is one you understand completely.
